My code took ibm and softlayer for example and training -> retrive other acquisition results.

0. create TRAIN datasets: 100% relevant and irrelevant to target relationship (ibm_sl_rel and ibm_sl_irrel in this case)
1. modify seeds and other parameters in REConfig.py if needed
2. python completeFlow.py
